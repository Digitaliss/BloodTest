BloodTest
=========

Hello. I am trying to create a program that takes the user's blood sugar test results every day for a month and 
return comments and statistics.

The number of days in the month is defined by the user. 
The number of tests per day is defined by the user.

The program will take the test results and return the daily average blood sugar level, as well as warnings or encouragements. 
At the end of the month, the program will also return the month average blood sugar level, as well as warnings or encouragements. 

The long term goal would be: 
1. Increase the number of statistics returned to the user
2. Find a way to prompt the user on a daily basis, instead of all at once when the program is started.

Cheers and thanks for reading.
